"How many block periods per year should it occupy (or which periods), All rotation run during every block of the year, excluding the constraints mentionned in the sheet. However, there may be specific constraints for single period rotations such as electives, research, Hand, Community. This would vary based on the availability of such rotations.",,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of concurrent resident slots in each of those periods (min/max), in the sheet already. These values are stable for each period, within the constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether any rotations share the same block (e.g., Research vs Elective). All rotations can share the same blocks, but a resident cannot be on 2 rotations at once. Eg. JGH foot runs all 13 blocks of the year, so does SMH, but a resident can’t be on both rotations during the same block.",,,,,,,,,,,
